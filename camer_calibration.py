    '''
    Generate two lists of calibration points from a set of calibration images
    of chess boards to needed for `cv2.calibrateCamera()`.
    
    It is recommended that `images` contain at least 20 images. All images
    are expected to be of identical size and to contain the same, complete
    chess board pattern.
    
    Args:
        images (array-like): A list of file names of the images to be
            used for calibration.
        nx (int): The number of horizontal inner corners (i.e. corners where two
            white and two black tiles meet) of the chess board.
        ny (int): The number of vertical inner corners (i.e. corners where two
            white and two black tiles meet) of the chess board.
            
    Returns:
        object_points (list): The list of 3-D object points for calibration.
        image_points (list): The list of 2-D image points for calibration.
