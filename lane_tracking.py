def bilateral_adaptive_threshold(img, ksize=30, C=0, mode='floor', true_value=255, false_value=0):
    '''
    Perform adaptive color thresholding on a single-channel input image.
    The function uses a cross-shaped filter kernel of 1-pixel thickness.
    The intensity value of a given pixel needs to be relatively higher (or lower, depending on the mode)
    than the average intensity value of either both the left and right sides or both the upper and lower
    sides of the kernel cross. This means in order to exceed the threshold, a pixel does not just need
    to be brighter than its average neighborhood, but instead it needs to be brighter than both sides
    of its neighborhood independently in either horizontal or vertical direction.
    This is useful for filtering lane line pixels, because the area on both sides of a lane line is darker
    than the lane line itself.
    Arguments:
        img (image file): The input image for which a filter mask is to be created.
        ksize (int, optional): The radius of the filter cross excluding the center pixel,
            i.e. for a ksize of `k`, the diameter of the cross will be 2k+1. Defaults to 30.
        C (int, optional): The required difference between the intensity of a pixel and
            its neighborhood in order to pass the threshold. If C = c, a pixel's intensity
            value needs to be higher/lower than that of its neighborhood by c in order to pass
            the threshold.
        mode (string, optional): One of 'floor' or 'ceil'. If set to 'floor', only pixels brighter
            than their neighborhood by C will pass the threshold. If set to 'floor', only pixels
            darker than their neighborhood by C will pass the threshold. Defaults to 'floor'.
        true_value (int, optional): The value to which mask pixels will be set for image pixels
            that pass the threshold. Must be in [0, 255]. Defaults to 255.
        false_value (int, optional): The value to which mask pixels will be set for image pixels
            that do not pass the threshold. Must be in [0, 255]. Defaults to 0.
    Returns:
        A mask of the same shape as the input image containing `true_value` for all pixels that
        passed the filter threshold and `false_value` elsewhere.

class LaneTracker:
    '''
    A lane tracker to track exactly two lane lines for a vehicle that is driving
    inside the respective lane. The lane tracker is designed to track the left
    and right lane lines that delimit the lane that the vehicle is driving in.
    In its current implementation, if the tracker detects only one of the two
    lane lines but not both, it will discard the detection as invalid.
    The tracker can fit curved lane lines up to a second-degree polynomial, i.e.
    it cannot currently track short stretches of S-shaped curves correctly.
    The LaneTracker object maintains state of tracking variables over multiple
    frames. In order to track lane lines, the only method you need to call is
    `process()`.

                the program prints a failure message onto the currently processed image. This failure message

        Process the input image to find the two lane lines of the lane which the
        car is driving in and hightlight the lane in the image.
        This method is the only method that needs to be called in order to use the
        lane tracker.
        Arguments:
            img (array-like): The image to be processed. The size of the image must
                correspond to the size set during initialization of the lane tracker
                object.
            ksize_r (int, optional): The filter size for the color thresholding
                process of the RGB R-channel. Note: For the filter mode 'bilateral',
                this is the number of pixels of the cross-shaped filter in each
                of the four directions, i.e. the diameter of the filter is `2 * ksize_r + 1`.
                For the filter mode 'neighborhood', this is the side length of a quadratic
                block filter, i.e. the diameter of the filter is `ksize_r`. In the latter
                case, this side length should ideally be odd. Defaults to 15.
            C_r (int, optional): The minimum difference by which a pixel needs to be
                brighter than its average neighborhood in the color thresholding
                process for the RGB R-channel. Defaults to 8.
            ksize_b (int, optional): The same as `ksize_r`, but for the LAB B-channel.
                Defaults to 35.
            C_b (int, optional): The same as `C_r`, but for the LAB B-channel.
                Defaults to 5.
            filter_type (string, optional): The type of filter to be used for the
                color thresholding process. Can be either 'bilateral' or 'neighborhood'.
                The former uses a cross-shaped filter, where a pixel needs to be brighter
                than the average of either both the left and right sides or both the upper
                and lower sides of the cross in order to meet the threshold. The latter
                has a square-shaped filter, where a pixel needs to be brighter than the
                average of all the pixels inside the filter area in order to meet the
                threshold. Defaults to 'bilateral'.
            mask_noise (bool, optional): If `True`, includes a special filtering process
                in the image filtering stage to reduce the effect of noise caused by
                greenery that is in immediate proximity of the road. The process uses
                the B-channel of the LAB colorspace for the filtering. Defaults to `False`.
            noise_thresh (int, optional): The lower LAB B-channel intensity value
                threshold from which upward a pixel is considered as belonging to the
                greenery. Defaults to 140.
            ksize_noise (int, optional): The ksize parameter for the filter that ignores
                yellow lane lines when filtering out greenery noise. Defaults to 65.
            C_noise (int, optional): The C parameter for the filter that ignores
                yellow lane lines when filtering out greenery noise. Defaults to 10.
            window_width (int, optional): The width of the search window for the sliding
                window search. All pixels inside the search window are considered
                lane line pixels, so the wider the search window, the more pixels might
                erroneously be considered lane line pixels. If the search window is too
                narrow, however, then many actual lane line pixels might be ignored,
                especially in sharp turns. Defaults to 30.
            window_height (int, optional): The height of the search window for the sliding
                window search. If the window height is larger, the search will iterate over
                the full image height in fewer iterations. If the window height is too large,
                then the sliding window search might fail to recognize sharp turns.
                Defaults to 40.
            search_range (int, optional): The symmetric range that the search window can slide
                to the left and right of its current position in the next iteration for the
                sliding window search. If the range is too narrow, the sliding window search
                might fail to recognize sharper turns. If it is too wide, then the search
                might consider noise pixels far to the left or right of the actual lane
                as lane pixels and thus fail entirely. Defaults to 20.
            mu (float, optional): A drift parameter that introduces momentum into the
                sliding window search. The larger mu, the more will the search range of
                the sliding window shift towards the direction of the window movement
                in pior iterations. This parameter can be used to facilitate tracking
                sharp turns, but it needs to be tuned carefully to prevent adverse effects.
                Shoudl be >= 0. Defaults to 0.1.
            no_success_limit (int, optional): The maximum number of consecutive unsuccessful
                sliding window search iterations before the search will be aborted. The lane
                pixels that were found up to this point will still be kept and used to fit
                lane lines. If this parameter is set too large, then the search window might
                continue moving into a completely wrong direction, but might eventually find
                pixels that are then erroneously considered lane line pixels, leading to a
                completely wrong detection. If this value is too small, on the other hand,
                then the search might be aborted in between two dashed lane lines.
                Defaults to 8.
            start_slice (float, optional): The vertical fraction of the image from the bottom
                that will be used to determine the horizontal starting points for the left and
                right search windows for the sliding window search. Must be in [0,1]. Defaults to 0.25.
            ignore_sides (int, optional): The number of margin pixels on the left and right sides
                of the image that will be ignored in the search for the starting points of the
                left and right search windows in the sliding window search. Defaults to 360.
            ignore_bottom (int, optional): The number of pixels from the bottom of the image
                that will be ignored in the search for the starting points of the
                left and right search windows in the sliding window search. This parameter might
                be important to exclude the vehicle's engine hood from affecting the search.
                Defaults to 30.
            bandwidth (int, optional): The width of the band (in pixels) to the left and right around the
                the graph of the last fitted lane line polynomial within which the tracker looks
                for lane line pixels in this frame. All pixels that lie within this band will be
                considered lane line pixels. Therefore, the larger the bandwidth, the more noise
                pixels will be considered lane pixels, while the smaller the bandwidth, the more
                likely the tracker will be to fail to detect sharper turns. Defaults to 25.
            partial (float, optional): The fraction of the warped image from the bottom in which
                lane lines will be detected. Must be in [0,1]. If set to 1.0, then lane lines
                will be predicted across the whole height of the bird's eye view of the image,
                while if set to 0.5, the tracker will only detect lane lines in the bottom half
                of the image and ignore the top half. Defaults to 1.0.
            n_tries (int, optional): Determines how many times the algorithm shall attempt to
                find valid lane lines in this image before giving up. Even though this parameter
                can be set to any integer value, at the moment the algorithm has a maximum of two
                attempt programs, i.e. this parameter should be either 1 or 2. The second attempt
                will perform the lane line search with its own set of parameters that are currently
                hard-coded in this method. Defaults to 2.
            visualize_search (bool, optional): If `True`, this method returns not only an annotated
                version of the input image in which the lane is highlighter (if it was identified),
                but also a second image showing a visualization of the search process. This can be
                useful to understand what the algorithm "saw" in the image and what it did under
                the hood, or why it might not perform as expected. Defaults to `False`.
            split_view (bool, optional): If `True`, returns a split-view image that contains
                three subframes. The first is the annotated input image with the lane highlighted
                (if it was identified), the second is the bird's eye view of the image, and the
                third is a visualization of the search process. Defaults to `False`.
            diagnostics (bool, optional): If `True`, prints out diagnostic information about
                the search process in the console, including what search type was used,
                which criteria of the internal lane line validity check were met or violated,
                and how many search attempts were used. Defaults to `False`.
        Returns:
            The annotated input image with the lane highlighted if it was successfuly detected.
            The estimated curve radius and the vehicle's distance from the center of the lane
            are also printed onto the image. The exact returned items depend on the arguments
            `visualize_search` and `split_view`.
